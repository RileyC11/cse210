Program

The cast is created with initial values within 'Program'. The 'cast' is created as a list of characters, with the 
characters being 'banner', 'robot', and 'artifacts'('rocks' and 'gems'). Here the 'rocks' and 'gems' are given 
their velocity, shape, and color.

Director

The game is run in 'Director' and updated as the game goes. Get the inputs for robot and update velocity.
Update the score displayed in banner, robot's location, and the locations of the rocks and gems.  

All other aspects of the code are straightforward. Artifact inherits all of the aspects of Actor but has the option for a score.
